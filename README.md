# **AI/ML Project**
This repository contains two directories in it, ***maze*** and ***wine_quality***.

## **Maze**
This directory contains a ***README*** file which explains the entire working of the program and a ***.py*** file which is the maze generation and solving algorithm. 

This is more so an AI project as it does not involve machine learning in it at all.

## **Wine Quality**
This directory contains a ***README*** file which explains the entire working of the program, three ***json*** files which contain the best parameters for each of the three **gradient boosting frameworks**, a ***requirements*** file which has all the required libraries that need to be installed, a ***.pkl*** file which contains the previously trained AI to load in for another session, a ***.csv*** file which holds the entire database on which the program is being trained and finally a ***.py*** file which has the entire code for the ML model.

This is a ML project as it uses the given data and its outcome to predict the outcome of any new data provided to it.
